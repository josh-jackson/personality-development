#### Course Description#### 

This seminar examines how individual differences develop over the lifespan. Or, in other words, how we become who we are. The scope of the class covers a multitude of individual differences constructs (e.g., happiness, IQ, psychopathology), but a particular focus will be on personality traits. Questions that will be examined include: How early in the lifespan does oneâ€™s personality emerge? How much do parents matter in shaping who you become? Does your personality change across the lifespan? Readings will cover theories of development at different life stages and empirical research from childhood to older adulthood.  

###Course Requirements:
1.	Reading summaries.  Respond to the thought question of the week and integrate at least one of the weekly readings into your response. Email your response to Josh prior to class. Length should be ~ 1 page double spaced. 

2.	Participation. It is important to have completed all of the readings before the class period. Participation during each class period is mandatory.  

3.	Final presentation and paper. Note: You need to meet with me to have the final project idea and paper approved. Final topic MUST be approved by Spring break. The final paper is an NSF style proposal (short, two pages, very direct) that identifies a research question and outlines a study that you would like to run. 

As part of the final paper you will give an in class presentation. The presentation will consist of an overview and discussion of a reading of your choosing and a description of your proposed study. The article should provide some background information (e.g., theory, design) to facilitate the description of your project.  

My hope with these projects is that many of you could turn your final project into a paper suitable for publication. Depending on your research question, I may already have access to datasets that could address your question.
